QuTiP Package
=============

These pages are the developers' guide to the main QuTiP package code base.  The
source code is available in the `GitHub repository qutip/qutip`_, which is the
primary location for filing issues and making pull requests.  Please read these
pages to help you understand how the ``qutip`` package is organised and how the
code works.

In general we assume that you have a working knowledge of using QuTiP as a user,
and these pages will not contain a tutorial on how to work with the library.  If
that is what you are looking for, please refer to the `user guide`_ or the large
collection of `example notebooks`_.

This developers' guide is intended for people who are looking to modify and
extend QuTiP, particularly the lower-level, more heavily optimised components.
