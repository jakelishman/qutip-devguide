Getting Started
===============

This page describes how to get a QuTiP development environment set up so that
you can begin contributing code, documentation or examples to QuTiP.  Please
stop by to talk to us either in the `QuTiP Google group`_ or in the issues page
on the `main QuTiP repository`_ if you have suggestions for new features, so we
can discuss the design and suitability with you.
